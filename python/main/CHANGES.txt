2008-09-21: Release 3.2b1

- StringTemplate.toString() now returns unicode strings and stringtemplate uses
  unicode internally as well (i.e. all passed in byte strings are converted to
  unicode).
- Added native group name to template name tags in the debug output.
- Fixed: int map keys didn't work.
- Added trunc, fixed rest and strip.
- Fixed ST-33; make [a,b] cat work.
- Added \r\n normalization in AutoIndentWriter. Converts \r\n or \n
  to whatever the writer's newline instance var is.  wrap="\n" will
  give the proper newline by locale as will \n and \r\n in the
  templates or even incoming data attributes (toString()'d of course).
  It even works with special literals <\r\n> and <\n>.
- Fixed ST-36; allow <elseif> keyword.

2008-02-17: Release 3.1

- Resolve ST-34.  Super group loading was not using template lexer
  (<...> or $...$) according to subclass. Updated group loader interface.
- Improved error message for "template not found"
- $first(list).prop$ was not allowed.  Fixed and added a unit test.
