<P>Version 2.2, June 15, 2006</P>

<P>2.2 is the third full release of the Python version of StringTemplate. It
is functionally equivalent to the Java StringTemplate version 2.2. Release 2.2
fixes a few bugs, but mainly 2.2 adds lots of great new features.
The features were added in response to my needs building ANTLR v3's
code generator and from feedback by StringTemplate users.
</P>

<P>2.2 should be a drop-in replacement for those using <TT>StringTemplate</TT>
for websites and code generation with a few minor potential
incompatibilities.
</P>

<H2>Enhancements</H2>

<UL>
<LI>You can define arguments for anonymous templates now, which is much
nicer that using <TT>it</TT> all the time:

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
$names:{n| &lt;b&gt;$n$&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;}; separator=","$
</PRE></FONT>


</LI>
<LI>added parallel attribute iteration where you can apply a template to
multiple lists of values; works for anonymous templates only:

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
$names,phones:{n,p | $n$: $p$}$
</PRE></FONT>

An error is generated if you have too many args for the number of
parallel lists.  Iteration proceeds while at least one of the
attributes (<TT>names</TT> or <TT>phones</TT>, in this case) has values.
</LI>
<LI>added "[a,b,c,...]" list operator to create multi-valued attributes,
yielding single, longer multi-valued attribute.  <TT>$[mine,yours]$</TT> is a
new list with both elements; all of <TT>mine</TT> first then all of <TT>yours</TT>.
</LI>
<LI>any template invocation assumes sole formal argument name if just
one formal argument defined in target template.  For example, if you
do <TT>$bold(name)$</TT> and <TT>bold</TT> has one formal argument, then it gets the
value of name.  This works also for template application:

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
test(names) ::= "&lt;names:bold(),italics()&gt;"
bold(x) ::= "*&lt;x&gt;*"
italics(y) ::= "_&lt;y&gt;_"
</PRE></FONT>


<B>Note</B>: The binding of a value to the name of a sole formal argument is
done dynamically so that indirect template invocation and lazy
evaluation stuff works properly.  For example <TT>(templateName)(value)</TT>
should work for different templates with differently-named (but sole)
formal arguments.  See unit test
<TT>TestInvokeIndirectTemplateWithSingleFormalArgs()</TT>.
</LI>

<LI>Added operators to get first, rest, last attribute elements; e.g.,
<TT>first(users)</TT> yields the first value of <TT>users</TT>.  <TT>rest(users)</TT>
returns all elements of <TT>users</TT> except the first; it returns nothing
if <TT>users</TT> is single-valued.  This introduces a function-like syntax,
which necessitated the "<em>assign to sole formal arg</em>" functionality
above that supports things like <TT>bold(name)</TT>.  You can combine
operations to say things like <TT>first(rest(names))</TT> to get second
element.  Can say <TT>first([mine,yours])</TT> to get the first of a combined
list.  These operators work on any iterable object.  [<em>backward
incompatible if you used first,last,tail as an attribute or template
name</em>]
</LI>

<LI>Added maps to StringTemplate groups.  For example,

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
typeInitMap ::= ["int"="0", "float"="0.0", default="null"]
</PRE></FONT>


then within a template you can refer to them <TT>&lt;typeInitMap.int&gt;</TT>,
which returns "0".  Those strings are actually templates, but I can't
really think of a use for that just yet! If your type name is an
attribute not a constant like int, then use
<TT>&lt;typeInitMap.(typeName)&gt;</TT>.  The maps are defined in the group's
scope and are visible if no attribute hides them.  For example, if you
define a formal argument called <TT>typeInitMap</TT> in template <TT>foo</TT>
then <TT>foo</TT> cannot see the map defined in the group (though you could
pass it in, which would be the point).  If a name is not an attribute and
it's not in the group's maps table, then the super group is consulted
etc...  You may not redefine a map and it may not have the same name
as a template in that group.  The <TT>default</TT> value is used if you use a
key as a property that doesn't exist.  For example <TT>&lt;typeInitMap.foo&gt;</TT>
returns "<TT>null</TT>".
</LI>

<LI>Added renderers per template and group.  Templates are inherited
from super group.  The new class <TT>AttributeRenderer</TT> defines how an
object is rendered to string.  Here is a renderer that 
renders <TT>Calendar</TT> date objects tersely.

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
import stringtemplate
import date from datetime

class DateRenderer(stringtemplate.AttributeRenderer):

    def str(self, o):
        return o.strftime("%Y.%m.%d")

...

st = stringtemplate.StringTemplate( \
		"date: &lt;created&gt;", \
		stringtemplate.language.AngleBracketTemplateLexer.Lexer)
st["created"] = date(year=2005, month=7, day=5)
st.registerRenderer(date, DateRenderer())
expecting = "date: 2005.07.05"
</PRE></FONT>


You can set the renderer for a class either at the group level or the
individual template level.  Thanks to Anton Keks for his suggestion and sample
implementation.
</LI>

<LI>template arguments can be anonymous templates now or simple strings.
  From the bug list:

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
Template inclusion expressions won't accept a nested template
as an argument.  I'd like to be able to write &lt;foo(bar={...})&gt;, which
would mean the same thing as &lt;foo(bar="":{...})&gt;.
</PRE></FONT>


Now you can do <TT>&lt;foo(bar={&lt;firstName&gt; &lt;lastName&gt;</TT>)&gt;}.
</LI>
<LI>added default values (strings or anonymous templates like explicit
template arguments) for formal arguments like

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
bold(x="empty") ::= ...
</PRE></FONT>

<B>Note:</B> because of lazy evaluation semantics, default value templates may
refer to argument values.  Everything is evaluated after arg values are set.
This works for invoked templates and templates you create with code.
</LI>

<LI>when calling another template, y, with formal arguments from within
a template, x, none of the x parameters are visible to y because the formal
parameters force you to define values.  This prevents surprises and makes it
easy to ensure a value is empty unless you specifically set it for that
template.  The problem is that you need to factor templates sometimes and want
to refine behavior with a subclass or just invoke another shared template but
<TT>&lt;y()&gt;</TT> erases all of x's parameters.  Now, use
<TT>&lt;y(...)&gt;</TT> as a syntax to indicate y should inherit all values.
<TT>&lt;y(name="foo", ...)&gt;</TT> would set one arg, but the others are
inherited whereas <TT>&lt;y(name="foo")&gt;</TT> only has <TT>name</TT> set;
others are empty. You can set manually with
<TT>stringtemplate.StringTemplate.setPassThroughAttributes()</TT>.
</LI>

<LI>When a property or argument is not found, you get a better error message.
I show the template context (nested tree of templates); e.g.,

<FONT SIZE=2><PRE>
no such attribute: decisionNumber in template context
[outputFile lexer cyclicDFA cyclicDFAState cyclicDFAEdge lookaheadTest]
</PRE></FONT>

</LI>

<LI>added ability to use indirect property names.  <TT>$user.(propName)$</TT>
evaluates <TT>(propName)</TT> to find the name of the property and then looks
it up in user object whereas <TT>$user.foo$</TT> looks for literally property
<TT>foo</TT> in <TT>user</TT> object.
</LI>

</UL>

<H2>Bug Fixes</H2>

<UL>

<LI>fields that were arrays didn't get treated as iterable objects
</LI>

<LI>When you invoke foo(x=y), x must be an attribute of foo (well if you
have formal args defined that is) and y is evaluated within the
context of the surrounding template; more precisely, it's evaluated in
the context of the actual template invocation (which can have
predefined attributes like <TT>attr</TT>, <TT>it</TT>, and <TT>i</TT>).  It's
weird, but <TT>foo(x=x)</TT> also makes sense.  See new unit test
<TT>TestArgEvaluationContext()</TT>.  This was not working before, though I
thought it was!
</LI>

<LI>Lists, dictionaries, and tuples that are non-null but have no elements
return false in conditionals; e.g., $if(users)$ is false if users is an empty
list. This is regular Python behaviour but wasn't in the StringTemplate
language.
</LI>

<LI>To define an empty template, you had to write &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;; an empty
string (&quot;&quot;) didn't work.
