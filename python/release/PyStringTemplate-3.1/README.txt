ABSTRACT
========

ST (StringTemplate) is a template engine (with ports for C# and Python)
for generating source code, web pages, emails, or any other formatted text
output. ST is particularly good at multi-targeted code generators, multiple
site skins, and internationalization/localization. It evolved over years of
effort developing jGuru.com. ST also generates this website and powers the
ANTLR v3 code generator. Its distinguishing characteristic is that it strictly
enforces model-view separation unlike other engines.
