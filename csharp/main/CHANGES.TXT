  ***BREAKING*** In IStringTemplateGroupLoader implementations, methods
  LoadGroup(string) and LoadGroup(string, StringTemplateGroup) now return
  StringTemplateGroup instances configured to use the "default" lexer type.
  Previously, they were hard-coded to use the 'DefaultTemplateLexer' type 
  (i.e. $...$). This is significant because the "default" lexer type is now
  the AngleBracketTemplateLexer (i.e. <..>).
  
- Attributes names may start with the underscore character (i.e '_')

- Fixed issues reported by Kenny Cockburn where checking for non-empty 
  IEnumerators resulted in skipped values and, any further reference to the 
  same attribute was dealing with an "empty" enumerator (one where the
  IEnumerator.MoveNext() method [always] returns false).
  
  i)  The test for empty enumerator no longers skips any values
  
  ii) Multiple references to an IEnumerator will **STILL** result in all but
      the first reference dealing with an "empty" enumerator.
      Use of an IEnumerator has side-effects and we may be dealing with
      deliberately "positioned" IEnumerators.

  Added [Ignore] tests to emphasize the multiple refs to IEnumerator issue.

- Attribute names cannot include the '.' (i.e. dot)
  Examples:
  	Legal names:    DateOfBirth     valid_name      unhyphenated
  	Illegal names:	date.of.birth   .invalid_name   

- Template names cannot include the '.' or '-' characters (i.e. dot and hyphen)
  Examples:
  	Legal names:    MyCoolTemplate     unhyphenated_name
  	Illegal names:	my.cool.template   hyphenated-name   

- Use StringTemplate.ToString(int lineWidth) to set the [approx] length 
  of each line before it is wrapped. Use new "wrap" option to specify a wrap
  delimiter (text that is output after the wrap):
  		<products; wrap="\n">

  See included tests for more on "wrap" including the related "anchor" option.
  
- New "null" option to specify a substitute value for nulls in a multi-valued 
  attribute. This is essentially a syntactic sugar for a  conditional tests on 
  each value. The following templates are functionally equivalent:
  
  	$values:{v|$if(v)$$v$$else$--null--$endif$}$
  	
  and
  
  	$values; null="--null--"$
  	 -OR-
  	<values; null="--null--">
  
- New "length()" operator returns the length of an attribute. Null single-valued 
  attributes have a length of 0. Null values in a multi-valued attributes are
  counted.
  
	$values:{$length(values)$)
	
- New "strip()" operator skips null values. Returns an empty string for a null 
  single-valued attribute and, strips out nulls from multi-valued attributes.
  
	$strip(values):{s|$s$}; separator=", "$

- Added this file ;-)

- Added Nant build files for all projects and tests.

  Also added ANTLR 2.7.6 executables (created with the excellent IKVM tool) 
  to the source distribution. This ensures the Nant build always has all it 
  needs to (re)build the project.

- FileSystemTemplateLoader now detects changes to watched files. This issue
  was triggered by the ST view engine for the excellent Castle.MonoRail 
  project.
  
- StringTemplate.dll assembly is now strong named

  For your own source builds, you will need to generate a key pair in a file
  named 'StringTemplate_KeyPair.snk' in the root of the ST# source tree.

- Added IAttributeStrategy {Luis Leal}

- Added HTML documentation (also available on the wiki) and a new i18n sample
  demonstrating an easy way of supporting site skinning and Localization with
  ST#.

- A StringTemplate's native group is now responsible for creating copies of 
  StringTemplate instances for GetInstanceOf().
  
- Introduced IStringTemplateGroupFactory to separate the concept of finding and 
  loading StringTemplateGroups and StringTemplateGroupInterfaces from that of 
  creating them. 
  
  Existing IStringTemplateGroupLoader implementation have been updated and can 
  now locate and create custom Group and GroupInterfaces classes.

- StringTemplateGroups and StringTemplateGroupInterfaces can now be loaded 
  from embedded *.stg/*.sti resources. See EmbeddedResourceGroupLoader.cs
  
- StringTemplates can now be loader from embedded *.st resources. 
  See EmbeddedResourceTemplateLoader.cs

- Added CompositeGroupLoader for using multiple IStringTemplateGroupLoaders.

- NullErrorListener is now a sealed class

- RemoveAttribute() no longers throws an exception if no attributes have 
  been defined.
  
- Removed overly eager whitespace trimming.

- Added more new useful constructors to StringTemplateGroup. 

  ***BREAKING*** StringTemplateGroup(string name) now loads templates 
  relative to the Application's BasePath (usually the location of the 
  assembly).
  
  ***BREAKING*** Most StringTemplateGroup constuctors now configure their 
  loader not to raise exceptions if a template isn't found. The logic used
  to locate/load templates in StringTemplateGroup itself may still raise 
  exceptions of course.
  
- StringTemplateGroup now checks that a cached template hasn't changed 
  before reusing it. If it has, it is reloaded. Checking may be expensive
  for some StringTemplateLoader implementations.
  
  Introduced StringTemplateGroup.TemplateHasChanged() to support the
  behaviour described above.
  
- Added basic DateTimeFormatter and NumberFormatter classes. Useful for 
  wrapping attributes.
